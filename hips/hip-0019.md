## Abstract

Helm hooks are currently executed serially. In many cases there will be no reason why they cannot be run in parallel. Running hooks in parallel can significantly improve install/upgrade times

## Motivation

Decrease install/upgrade times by executing hooks in parallel

## Specification

Add a new flag to the install, upgrade, rollback and uninstall commands to enable parallel behavior for hook execution. The flag will be of integer type and will allow the user to specify the maximum number of hooks that can be executed in parallel.

The flag shall be optional. If not set or set to "0" or "1", hook execution shall be done serially. If set to a value greater than "1", hook execution shall be done in parallel, subject to not exceeding the given value in the number of hooks executed in parallel.

Only hooks of the same weight shall be executed in parallel.

## Rationale

While it may be desirable to run hooks in parallel, particularly those of the same weight, doing so by default may cause issues for users depending on the existing serial behavior. Therefore it is proposed to keep the existing serial behavior by default and enable parallel behavior through the use of a flag.

Making the flag an integer rather than boolean allows the user to possibility to restrict the number of parallel processes where resource constraints are a concern.

Allowing hooks of different weights to be executed in parallel is probably not consistent with the documented behavior of lower weight hooks being executed before higher weighted hooks and, therefore only hooks of the same weight shall be executed in parallel

## Backwards compatibility

Proposed solution is fully backwards compatible with no changes in default behavior.

## Security implications

None

## How to teach this

Document in command line help and https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts_hooks/.

## Reference implementation

PR submitted some time ago: https://github.com/helm/helm/pull/11804
May need to be updated depending on decisions taken on what is proposed here.

## Rejected ideas

Why certain ideas that were brought while discussing this HIP were not
ultimately pursued.
